SECTION 3 (theory challenge)

Question 1: 
Definition and explanation of SQL Injection

SQL injection is a type of attack that hackers can use to mess with data.
It inserts an SQL code to manipulate that data which can result in deleting some of it, modifying it etc.
Its exploiting vulnerabilities  in the application's input validation mechanisms to compromise the integrity.
For example hackers can use it to login into accounts without the passwords because they change the structure
of the SQL code and add an exception.

Question 2:
Types of SQL Injection Attacks

- classic SQL injection: they inject directly into input ffields which alters the structure.
- blind SQL injection: the attackers inject the malicious code into the input fields as well but this
type is called blind because the user wont see the error results of the query.

Question 3:
Impact of SQL Injection

This type of a attack can be very dangerous and can result in data breaches, where attackers can gain
access to some sensitive data like personal information. They can manipulate the data in ways that it
creates data corruption and destroy companies/businesses.
They can steal someone's identity and put them at risk of fraud etc.

Question 4:
Mitigation Strategies:

- validation
- sanitization
- testing
- database hardening
- web app firewall
- preperaed statements
